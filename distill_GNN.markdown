## A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks

From https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/

A set of objects, and the connections between them, are naturally expressed as a graph

### Problems have graph structured data
- Graph-level task:

#### Thinking in early / spatio temporal / graph aspects:

directed edge: one-way street

like dictionary? 

define a structure
